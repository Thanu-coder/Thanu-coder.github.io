<p> Player Unknowns Battlegrounds is world famous game. 100 Million active players has on it.It is same as Call Of Duty Mobile.
    I like it's battle pass most. It was created by Activision Coporation And Quantum and lightroom Coporation. It has most 
    powerfull graphic quality. It's requirs are 2gb ram and more. It is best game i have ever seen.</p>
